# CANDY
Skin "engine" for barotrauma

// HUMAN.XML -> MOD'S XML 
// HUMAN2.XML -> CORE REPLACEMENT
// CANDY.XML -> 2ND CORE PACKAGE
// VANILLA.XML -> BASE BUT MODIFIED CORE PACKAGE
// RAGDOLL.XML -> MOD'S XML

// Do not mix them right now. Look at the Issues tab for more info

// Its still in experimenting mode.

// How to get it work? Use the update Human.xml with the updated Ragdoll.xml to get the error message posted in "Issues" Tab.
// Alternately you can use CANDY/VANILLA (uploaded here, these are almost the same, use Vanilla.xml instead) to tweak the core package. MAKE SURE TO HAVE BACKUP! 
If it wouldnt be possible to have CANDY as core package besides VANILLA(The one that comes with the game) that'd be the ideal goal!

Ultimate goal: Add CANDY as core package into the game. 

How it meant to work: CANDY "should be" a core package.
What is a core package? > It tells the game what files to look at when loading content. 

The core package coming with the game called "Vanilla" this tells the game to look for Human.xml which is the basic human body "format" for the game. Having a 2nd version of this packed with a mod, seems to cause issues. So the change of a core package would re-write the routes for files and we can make the game read "our" files instead. 

How it would be used ?  ( Its just a plan )
1. You'll need CANDY as a core package. 
2. You get skin mods from workshop > The mod would come with texture files and ragdoll.xml. 
3. Enable CANDY to read the files we want.
4. Enable skinmods and it should work just like before the ###### update.
