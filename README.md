# CANDY
Skin "engine" for barotrauma

// HUMAN.XML -> MOD'S XML 
// HUMAN2.XML -> CORE REPLACEMENT
// CANDY.XML -> 2ND CORE PACKAGE
// VANILLA.XML -> BASE BUT MODIFIED CORE PACKAGE
// RAGDOLL.XML -> MOD'S XML

// Do not mix them right now. Look at the Issues tab for more info

// Its still in experimenting mode.

// How to get it work? Use the update Human.xml with the updated Ragdoll.xml to get the error message posted in "Issues" Tab.
// Alternately you can use CANDY/VANILLA (uploaded here, these are almost the same, use Vanilla.xml instead) to tweak the core package. MAKE SURE TO HAVE BACKUP! 
If it wouldnt be possible to have CANDY as core package besides VANILLA(The one that comes with the game) that'd be the ideal goal!
